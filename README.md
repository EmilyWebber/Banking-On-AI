# Banking On AI
An Immersion Day for AI/ML in Financial Services Advertising

**Overview:** This repository contains a set of instructions, examples, and guidelines for an Immersion Day focusing on AI/ML. First we'll talk about best practices in machine learning, focusing on Amazon Sagemaker. Next, we'll create our first Sagemaker Notebook instance, along with our S3 bucket. After that, we'll follow a tutorial to understand one machine learning workflow. 

In the afternoon, we'll apply what we learned by having a small competition! Workshop participants will break into teams of 2-3. You'll be given a data set, and will have 4 hours to build a machine learning model that generates predictions against a withheld validation set. 

At the end of the day, the winning team gets a prize!
