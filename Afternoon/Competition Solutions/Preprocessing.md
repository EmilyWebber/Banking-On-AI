# Preprocessing Techniques
A lot of the manual labor required to complete a successful machine learning project is the data preprocessing. This can include steps such as:
- Imputing or dropping missing values
- Converting strings into floats and/or integers
- Normalizing numerical values
- Converting categorical values into binary indicators (one hot encoding)
- Remove outliers
- Remove columns that are constant throughout the data set
- Remove columns that too strongly correlate with each other
- Handle time series data

## Learning Objectives
Many of those techniques are outside the scope of a 1-day workshop, so here we will provide a preprocessing script that performs many of these necessary functinos.

This means that you will only need to run this preprocessing script, which will transform your data into a set that is ready for modeling.

## How to run the script


## What the script is doing
(1) Processing numerical data:
    - Impute missing values
    - Detect outliers
    - Transform columns that are skewed to the right with the log function
    - Standardize numberical columns
    
(2) Process time series data:
    - 
    
(3) Handle categorical data


(4) Perform one hot encoding
